## Task
Task at the [png image](Frontend Developer test assignment.png)

This test based on [react-redux starter kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit)

## Requirements
* node `^5.0.0`
* yarn `^0.23.0` or npm `^3.0.0`

## Installation

Install the project dependencies. It is recommended that you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for deterministic dependency management, but `npm install` will suffice.

```bash
$ yarn  # Install project dependencies (or `npm install`)
```

## Running the Project

After completing the [installation](#installation) step, you're ready to start the project!

```bash
$ yarn start  # Start the development server (or `npm start`)
```

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `yarn start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|`yarn <script>`    |Description|
|-------------------|-----------|
|`start`            |Serves your app at `localhost:3000`|
|`build`            |Builds the application to ./dist|
|`lint`             |[Lints](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8503559/what-is-linting) the project for potential errors|
